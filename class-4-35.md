# Graphs

## Terms
- **Vertex:** also known as a "node," is a data object with zero or more adjacent vertices

- **Edge:** connection between 2 nodes

- **Neighbor:** adjacent nodes, connected via an edge

- **Degree:** number of edges connected to a vertex

## Directed Vs. Undirected Graphs

**Undirected**
a graph where each edge is bi-directional whereby the graph doesn't move in any direction

**Directed**
also called a "diagraph" - graph where every edge is directed (diagram will show arrows)

## Complete Vs. Connected Vs. Disconnected Graphs
**Complete:**
when all nodes are connected to other nodes

**Connected:**
a graph that has all of vertices & nodes have all have at least one edge

**Disconnected:**
a graph where some vertices do not have edges ("islands")

## Acyclic Vs. Cyclic

**Cycle:** group of nodes that allow a looped traversal

**Acyclic:** a directed graph without cycles

**Cyclic:** a graph with cycles

## Graph Representation
1. **Adjacency Matrix:**
represented by a 2-dimensional array

1. **Adjacency List:**
most common represntation

## Weighted Graphs
a graph with numbers assigned to its edges called weights
