# useState() Hook

1. **How does React differ from vanilla JS/HTML/CSS?**
- Plain JS apps usually start with the initial UI created on the server (as HTML), whereas React apps start with a blank HTML page, and dynamically create the initial state in JavaScript.

- React requires you to break your UI into components, but plain JS apps can be structured in any way you see fit.

**1. What is the primary difference between a function component and a class component?**
- A functional component is just a plain JavaScript function that accepts props as an argument and returns a React element.	

- A class component requires you to extend from React. Component and create a render function which returns a React element.

## Vocab
- **Functional Components**: see above
- **Children / Child Components**: Children allow you to pass components as data to other components, just like any other prop you use.
