1. **What’s the difference between a framework and a library?**
The technical difference between a framework and library lies in a term called inversion of control.

When you use a library, you are in charge of the flow of the application. You are choosing when and where to call the library. When you use a framework, the framework is in charge of the flow. It provides some places for you to plug in your code, but it calls the code you plugged in as needed.

## Vocab
- **Rendering:**
Rendering is a process used in web development that turns website code into the interactive pages users see when they visit a website. The term generally refers to the use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript codes. The process is completed by a rendering engine, the software used by a web browser to render a web page. Because of its close association with web browsers, rendering engines are commonly referred to as browser engines.[Ref](https://www.seobility.net/en/wiki/Rendering)
- **Templates:**
Javascript templating is a fast and efficient technique to render client-side templates with Javascript using a JSON data source. The template is HTML markup, peppered with tags that will either insert variables or run programming logic.[Ref](https://www.newmediacampaigns.com/blog/javascript-templates-and-how-we-use-them-in-hifi)
- **State:**
State describes the status of the entire program or an individual object. It could be text, a number, a boolean, or another data type.

It’s a common tool for coordinating code. For example, once you update state, a bunch of different functions can instantly react to that change.[Ref](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/state-in-javascript-explained-by-cooking-a-simple-meal-2baf10a787ee/)
