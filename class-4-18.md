# AWS: API, Dynamo and Lambda

**1. What are serverless functions?**
a programmatic function written by a software developer for a single purpose. It's then hosted and maintained on infrastructure by cloud computing companies. These companies take care of code maintenance and execution so that developers can deploy new code faster and easier.  [Ref](https://blog.hubspot.com/website/serverless-functions)

**1. If you were to create a system that emulated Lambda functions, how would you do it?**
I honestly have no idea at this point.

**1. Describe how a CDN(Content Delivery Network) works.**
To minimize the distance between the visitors and your website’s server, a CDN stores a cached version of its content in multiple geographical locations (a.k.a., points of presence, or PoPs). Each PoP contains a number of caching servers responsible for content delivery to visitors within its proximity.

In essence, CDN puts your content in many places at once, providing superior coverage to your users. For example, when someone in London accesses your US-hosted website, it is done through a local UK PoP. This is much quicker than having the visitor’s requests, and your responses, travel the full width of the Atlantic and back.

## Vocab
- **Serverless Functions**
see above
- **Cloud Storage**
 a model of computer data storage in which the digital data is stored in logical pools, said to be on "the cloud". The physical storage spans multiple servers (sometimes in multiple locations), and the physical environment is typically owned and managed by a hosting company. [Ref](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_storage)
- **CDN**
a geographically distributed network of proxy servers and their data centers. [Ref](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network)


## Preview
**1. Which 3 things had you heard about previously and now have better clarity on?**
What CDN's, serverless functions, and cloud storage are.

**1. Which 3 things are you hoping to learn more about in the upcoming lecture/demo?**
More about the same.
**1. What are you most excited about trying to implement or see how it works?**
To see how the above is integrated into our code.
